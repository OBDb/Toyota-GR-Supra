generations:
  - name: "First Generation (A40/A50)"
    start_year: 1978
    end_year: 1981
    description: "The first-generation Toyota Supra began as a premium variant of the Celica, known as the Celica Supra or Celica XX in some markets, featuring distinctive styling with quad headlights, a longer wheelbase to accommodate the inline-six engine, and more luxurious features. Powered by a 2.6-liter (later 2.8-liter) inline-six engine producing approximately 110-116 horsepower depending on market and model year, the original Supra positioned itself as a comfortable grand tourer rather than an outright sports car. Available with either a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission driving the rear wheels, the Supra offered modest performance but with more refinement than the standard Celica. The interior featured a driver-oriented dashboard with a comprehensive gauge package, and equipment levels were upscale for the era with available leather upholstery, power windows, and air conditioning. This generation established the Supra nameplate (derived from the Latin prefix meaning 'above' or 'beyond') and its initial positioning as a premium sports coupe, though it remained closely tied to its Celica origins while adding the straight-six engine configuration that would become a defining characteristic of subsequent Supra generations."

  - name: "Second Generation (A60)"
    start_year: 1981
    end_year: 1985
    description: "The second-generation Toyota Supra continued as a derivative of the Celica but with more distinctive styling, featuring angular lines, pop-up headlights, and a more aggressive overall appearance reflecting automotive design trends of the early 1980s. Still marketed as the Celica Supra in many regions, this generation further distinguished itself from the standard Celica with a longer wheelbase, wider track, and more comprehensive performance enhancements. Powered by a 2.8-liter inline-six engine (5M-GE) with dual overhead cams, producing approximately 145-175 horsepower depending on market and model year, paired with either a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission, the second-generation Supra offered improved performance while maintaining its grand touring character. The introduction of independent rear suspension improved handling significantly over its predecessor, while four-wheel disc brakes provided enhanced stopping power. The interior featured a more driver-focused design with deeply bolstered seats, a comprehensive gauge cluster, and available luxury features including leather upholstery, power windows, and an upgraded audio system. Later models offered a Performance Package with sport suspension, limited-slip differential, and wider tires. This generation began shifting the Supra's positioning more toward performance while maintaining premium features, establishing it as Toyota's flagship sports coupe and laying the groundwork for its eventual evolution into a dedicated high-performance vehicle separate from the Celica."

  - name: "Third Generation (A70)"
    start_year: 1986
    end_year: 1992
    description: "The third-generation Toyota Supra marked a significant evolution, separating completely from the Celica to become a distinct model on its own platform, signifying its elevated status in Toyota's lineup. Featuring more rounded, contemporary styling with a prominent rear spoiler on Turbo models, pop-up headlights, and wider, more aggressive proportions, this generation embraced the performance focus that would come to define the nameplate. Engine options varied by market but were centered around the 3.0-liter inline-six in naturally aspirated (7M-GE) and, most significantly, turbocharged (7M-GTE) forms, the latter producing up to 232 horsepowerâ€”a substantial figure for the era. Transmission options included a five-speed manual, optional six-speed manual on later models, or four-speed automatic. The chassis featured double-wishbone suspension at all four corners, providing a sophisticated foundation for impressive handling capabilities, while innovations like available electronically controlled shock absorbers (TEMS) showcased Toyota's investment in performance technology. The interior continued the driver-focused theme with a wraparound cockpit design, comprehensive gauges including a boost meter on Turbo models, and available luxury features such as power-adjustable seats, leather upholstery, and a premium sound system. This generation firmly established the Supra as a serious performance car capable of competing with more expensive European and American sports coupes, particularly in turbocharged form, while maintaining reasonable practicality as a daily driver. The A70 Supra developed a strong following among performance enthusiasts, particularly for its robust engine design that proved highly receptive to aftermarket modifications and tuning."

  - name: "Fourth Generation (A80)"
    start_year: 1993
    end_year: 2002
    description: "The fourth-generation Toyota Supra represents the pinnacle of the nameplate's original run, featuring radical styling with a rounded, organic form, distinctive circular taillights, and an optional large rear wing that created one of the most recognizable sports car silhouettes of the 1990s. Significantly lighter than its predecessor through extensive use of aluminum and reduced equipment in certain models, this Supra prioritized performance above all else. Powered by the legendary 3.0-liter 2JZ inline-six engine in naturally aspirated (2JZ-GE, 220 horsepower) or twin-turbocharged (2JZ-GTE, 276 horsepower in Japan, 320 horsepower in export markets) forms, the latter featuring sequential turbochargers to virtually eliminate lag, paired with either a six-speed manual (Turbo only) or four-speed automatic transmission. The sophisticated chassis utilized double-wishbone suspension at all four corners, large brakes, and variable power steering, creating exceptional handling capabilities that could challenge much more expensive sports cars. The interior focused on the driver with a wraparound cockpit design, excellent ergonomics, and a relatively simple layout emphasizing function over luxury. This generation achieved legendary status for its extraordinary performance potential, with the twin-turbocharged variant in particular demonstrating exceptional durability and capacity for aftermarket modifications, with many examples reliably producing double or triple the factory horsepower rating with appropriate upgrades. The A80 Supra was discontinued in most markets by 1998 due to declining sales of sports cars, tightening emissions regulations, and rising production costs, though production continued for the Japanese market until 2002. Its cultural impact was amplified through prominent appearances in movies, video games, and racing series, maintaining enthusiast interest during the two decades between its discontinuation and eventual revival, with well-preserved examples commanding extraordinary prices on the collector market."

  - name: "Fifth Generation (A90)"
    start_year: 2020
    end_year: null
    description: "The fifth-generation Toyota Supra marks the revival of the iconic nameplate after a 17-year hiatus, developed as part of a joint venture with BMW that also produced the Z4 roadster. Designed with input from Toyota's Gazoo Racing motorsport division (hence the 'GR' prefix used in some markets), the new Supra features dramatic styling with a double-bubble roof, prominent front fenders, integrated ducktail rear spoiler, and numerous functional air vents and aerodynamic elements that create a distinctive appearance while honoring the heritage of previous generations, particularly the fourth-generation A80. The underlying chassis and powertrain are largely BMW-sourced, with the Supra initially launching with a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six engine (maintaining the straight-six tradition) producing 335 horsepower and 365 lb-ft of torque (later increased to 382 horsepower and 368 lb-ft for 2021), paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission driving the rear wheels. In 2021, a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine option was added to the lineup, producing 255 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque. After considerable enthusiast demand, a six-speed manual transmission became available for the six-cylinder model in 2023. Performance is impressive with the six-cylinder achieving 0-60 mph in approximately 3.9 seconds (later 3.8 with the power increase). The chassis features adaptive variable suspension, an electronically controlled limited-slip differential, and a near-perfect 50:50 weight distribution. The two-seat interior combines BMW switchgear and infotainment with Toyota-specific instrumentation and trim, featuring a driver-focused cockpit design with high-quality materials. Special editions have included the Launch Edition, A91 Edition, and various market-specific special models offering unique colors and equipment. While the BMW collaboration generated some controversy among purists, the fifth-generation Supra has generally received acclaim for its engaging handling, strong performance, and striking design, successfully reviving one of Toyota's most storied performance nameplates while providing a modern interpretation of the front-engine, rear-wheel drive sports car formula."
